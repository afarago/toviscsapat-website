<p>TövisCsapat Robotics has started its first team in 2014 on the First Lego League FLL robot programming competition. The team has connected more than twenty-six kids with STEAM and programming so far. 
We have learnt the basics of programming and during the years had opportunity to deep dive into the challenges of learning in the future, waste management, raising and protecting animals, human water management, space science and city construction.

We are quite proud that as TövisCsapat started with FLL robotics team in 2014 and have encouraged over 50 kids to spend countless engineering hours and joy, achieving awesome results with teams TövisCsapat and TövisASAP in World Festival. Eversince as kids in the club engage with FLL Junior, WRO Regular and WRO Open we were able to transform to Tövis Robo Club.
</p>
<p>Together with fantastic teams and persons we understood that the most we can gain is what we learn, not what we win.</p>
